Title:
Visual Analytics of Agricultural Crop Yields Across Indian States
Background:
Agriculture remains the backbone of the Indian economy, contributing significantly to employment and food security. Monitoring and analyzing crop yield trends at both temporal and geographic levels is essential for planning, policymaking, and ensuring sustainability in the agricultural sector.
With increasing availability of open government datasets, there is a need for interactive tools to transform raw data into meaningful insights.

Objective:
To develop a visual dashboard that allows users to:
Explore crop-wise yield trends across Indian states
Track changes in yield over multiple years
Understand regional patterns of agricultural productivity
Dataset Source:
Agricultural Statistics of India
Available on: Kaggle
This dataset includes year-wise, state-wise data on area, production, and yield for various crops.
Scope of Work / Tasks:
Data Aggregation & Cleaning:
Crop-wise aggregation of yield data (in kg/hectare)
Filter by major crops (e.g., rice, wheat, maize, etc.)
Handle missing or inconsistent entries
Year-wise Trend Visualization:
Create line/bar charts showing yield trends for each crop
Allow filtering by state or crop
Interactive Dashboard:
Crop selection dropdown
Year slider
Linked visual elements (e.g., maps update when chart is filtered)
Tools & Technologies Used:
Power BI for dashboard creation, data modeling, and state-wise mapping
Microsoft Excel / Power Query for initial data preprocessing
Data from kaggle
Outcomes:
Interactive dashboard showing:
Year-wise crop yield charts
State-level yield visualization on a map
Insights into productivity patterns, underperforming regions, and high-yield states
Decision support for policymakers, agri-businesses, and researchers
Impact & Applications:
Helps government and NGOs in identifying regions requiring agricultural support
Enables data-driven agricultural planning
Useful for students, researchers, and analysts studying food security and crop performance
Can be extended to include climate, irrigation, and soil quality correlations
